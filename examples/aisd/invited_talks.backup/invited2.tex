There exist approximately 166 billion small molecules, with 970 million deemed druglike. Similarly there is a vast pool of molecule candidates for new materials. This scarcity underscores the urgent need for innovative approaches, calling upon the NLP community to contribute significantly to medicine and material science. However, the challenges are manifold. Existing large language models (LLMs) alone are insufficient due to their tendency to generate erroneous claims confidently. Moreover, traditional knowledge bases do not adequately address the issue. This gap persists because chemistry language diverges significantly from natural language, demanding specialized domain knowledge, joint molecule and language modeling, and critical thinking. Using drug discovery, personalized drug synergy, and material discovery as case studies, I will present our approaches to tackle these challenges and turn an AI agent into a Medicinal Chemist or Material Scientist. I will share preliminary results from animal testing conducted on drug variants, and newly discovered material variants for efficient Organic Photovoltaic Devices proposed by AI algorithms.
