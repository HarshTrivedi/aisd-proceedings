Welcome to NLRSE, the Second Workshop on Natural Language Reasoning and Structured Explanations, co-located with ACL 2024 in Bangkok, Thailand. With recent scaling of large pre-trained Transformer language models (LLMs), the scope of feasible NLP tasks has broadened. Significant recent work has focused on tasks that require some kind of natural language reasoning. A trajectory in question answering has led us from extraction-oriented datasets like SQuAD to “multi-hop” reasoning datasets like HotpotQA and StrategyQA. Although LLMs have shown remarkable performance on most NLP tasks, it is often unclear why their answers follow from what they know. To address this gap, a new class of explanation techniques has emerged which play an integral part in structuring the reasoning necessary to solve these datasets. For example, the chain-of-thought paradigm leverages explanations as vehicles for LLMs to mimic human reasoning processes. Entailment trees offer a way to ground multi-step reasoning in a collection of verifiable steps. Frameworks like SayCan bridge high-level planning in language and with low-level action trajectories. As a result, we see a confluence of methods blending explainable machine learning/NLP, classical AI (especially theorem proving), and cognitive science (how do humans structure explanations?). This workshop aims to bring together a diverse set of perspectives from these different traditions and attempt to establish common ground for how these various kinds of explanation structures can tackle a broad class of reasoning problems in natural language and beyond. A total of 7 papers appear in the proceedings. 40 papers were presented at the workshop itself, with the rest being submitted under two archival options: cross-submissions (Findings papers or those already presented at other venues, such as EMNLP or the ACL main conference), and regular non-archival submissions (unpublished work). The latter went through a normal peer review process. These papers can be found on the NLRSE website: https://nl-reasoning-workshop.github.io/

Six papers were featured as oral presentations. These papers represented a selection of strong work that the organizers felt would be of broad interest to workshop participants. In addition, we featured four invited talks: Sherry Wu, Karthik Narasimhan, Thomas Icard, and Lorraine Li.

We are thankful to all reviewers for their help in the selection of the program, for their readiness in engaging in thoughtful discussions about individual papers, and for providing valuable feedback to the authors. We would also like to thank the ACL workshop organizers for all the valuable help and support with organizational aspects of the conference. Finally, we would like to thank all our authors and presenters for making this such an exciting event!
